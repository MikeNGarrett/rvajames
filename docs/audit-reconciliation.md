# RVA James — Audit Reconciliation

Cross-references each finding from `modern-web-evaluation-findings.md` against the staged plans, with **actual current state verified against the git history and codebase**.

**Last reconciled: 2026-05-24** (after session that fixed cron, gauge, sparkline, admin UX, typography, and CSO ingest). Earlier versions of this doc significantly understated what had shipped — the team had been executing in parallel sessions faster than the doc was being updated. This version is built from `git log` and direct codebase inspection.

## Status of all 23 audit findings

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | high | LCP inside Suspense boundary inflates to ~9.5 s | ✅ **DONE** — Round 3 sub-goal 38 (commit `d722386`). Deterministic hero is now the LCP element. |
| 2 | high | CLS skeleton ≠ panel height | ✅ **DONE** — Round 5 (commit `581c4be`). |
| 3 | high | `metadataBase` is workers.dev | ✅ **DONE** — Round 5 and Round 6 (commits `581c4be`, `dc16684`). |
| 4 | high | `text-text-muted` fails AA contrast | ✅ **DONE** — Round 5 (commit `581c4be`). |
| 5 / 11 | high / medium | Location card aria-label mismatch (WCAG 2.5.3) | ✅ **DONE** — Round 3 sub-goal 38 (commit `d722386`). |
| 6 | medium | `cache-control: no-store` disables BF-Cache | ✅ **DONE** — Round 6 (commit `dc16684`). |
| 7 | medium | Static assets missing `immutable` directive | ✅ **DONE** — Round 6 (commit `dc16684`). |
| 8 | medium | Missing security headers (XFO, XCTO, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) | ✅ **DONE** — Round 6 (commit `dc16684`). |
| 9 | medium | favicon.ico returns 404 | ✅ **DONE** — Round 5/6 (commits `581c4be`, `dc16684`). |
| 10 | medium | Cloudflare beacon third-party request | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** — preconnect likely landed in Round 6; full self-host deferred. Verify via response headers. |
| 12 | low | Legacy JS polyfills (~11 KB) | ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Round 8 candidate. |
| 13 | low | No dark mode support | ⏳ **DEFERRED** — own round if/when prioritized. |
| 14 | low | Nunito Sans `display: swap` FOUT/CLS risk | ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Round 8 candidate. |
| 15 | low | `ConditionsForm` uses `router.push` instead of `nuqs` setters | ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Round 7 candidate. |
| 16 | low | View Transitions not used for filter navigation | ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Round 7 candidate. |
| 17 | low | No CSP — start with Report-Only | ⚠️ **VERIFY** — not in the Round 6 commit message (`dc16684` cited "Findings 3, 6–9"). Confirm via response headers. |
| 18 | low | `withIngestionRun` swallows INSERT errors | ✅ **DONE** — verified in `lib/ingest/run.ts` with explicit `// (Finding 18)` comment. |
| 19 | low | Flat heading hierarchy (all `<h2>`) | ✅ **DONE** — Round 3 sub-goal 38 (commit `d722386`). |
| 20 | low | No OG image defined | ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Round 8 candidate. Depends on Finding 3 (done). |
| 21 | nit | Speculation rules are CDN-default | ✅ **DONE** — Round 3 sub-goal 38 (commit `d722386`). |
| 22 | nit | `color-mix()` not used for subtle variants | ✅ **DONE** — Round 5 (commit `581c4be`). |
| 23 | nit | Container queries not used for activity grid | ⏳ **NOT STARTED** — Round 9 sub-goal 51 (responsive application). |

**Summary:** 16 ✅ done · 2 ⚠️ partial/verify · 5 ⏳ pending.

## Out-of-scope notes — disposition

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| `/brand` returns 404 in production | ✅ **DONE** — verified gated in Round 5. |
| `water_temp_f` null for both gauges | ⏳ Open — not investigated; may be a USGS API parameter request issue. |
| `ingestion_runs` stuck rows (finished_at null) | ✅ Resolved by Finding 18 fix (new runs are reliable; legacy stuck rows can be cleaned in a SQL one-liner if desired). |
| `ConditionsForm` button aria-label | ⏳ Folds into Round 7 (ConditionsForm modernization). |
| `prefers-reduced-motion` not handled | ✅ **DONE** — Round 5. |
| `/locations/[slug]/opengraph-image` URL origin | ✅ Fixed by Finding 3 fix. Full OG image work is still Round 8 / Finding 20. |
| Cloudflare beacon self-injection vs. disable | ⚠️ Preconnect likely added; full self-host or disable deferred. |

## Remaining work — recommended execution order

```
NOW    Round 9 sub-goals 49–52 — responsive application
              Apply the foundation from sub-goal 48 across all routes and
              components; convert relocatable components to container queries
              (resolves Finding 23); visual regression sweep at 375 → 1920px.

LATER  Round 17 verify — confirm CSP report-only is actually deployed
              The Round 6 commit said "Findings 3, 6–9" — Finding 17 (CSP)
              may or may not have landed. Curl the live URL to confirm.

LATER  Round 7 — Findings 15, 16 (filter UX modernization)
LATER  Round 8 — Findings 12, 14, 20 (polish: legacy JS, font, OG images)
LATER  Cloudflare beacon — self-host or disable (Finding 10 partial)
LATER  water_temp_f investigation
DEFER  Finding 13 — dark mode
```

## How this doc gets out of sync (and how to keep it honest)

This doc has gone stale twice. Pattern: the team executes in fresh `/goal` sessions that update plan files and write commits, but the reconciliation only updates when explicitly asked. To prevent further drift:

- **After any session that ships work, run a quick verification:**
  ```bash
  git log --oneline -20
  ls supabase/migrations/
  ls app/api/cron/ components/ui/ lib/ingest/
  ```
- **Cross-reference against this table.** Anything new in the codebase but not marked `✅ DONE` here is drift.
- **Patches:** when a finding ships, change `⏳` to `✅ DONE` plus the commit SHA. Single edit, 10 seconds.

A future agent reading this without doing the verification will reach the same wrong conclusions earlier versions did. The codebase is the source of truth; the plan files and this reconciliation are working notes that lag.
